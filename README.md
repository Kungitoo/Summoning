Summoning - "Referrals of the future"
========================================
My bot was never meant for assholes to use in normal queues and ruin player experience. It originally started as me just wanting to level up smurf accounts and to overall test things out with RTMP.
Please, if you do plan on using this follow the same ethics. I built a Container class to allow you to seperate games per bots (CUSTOM 3x3, 5x5 or CoopVsAI 5x5) without having to interact with other players.
